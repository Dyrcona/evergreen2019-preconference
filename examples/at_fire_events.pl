# This script can be used to rerun events that got "stuck" for some
# reason, for instance the action_trigger_runner.pl got hung up on a
# large event or something.  You pass in a bunch of event ids on
# standard input and it will fire them. Here's an example of a
# possible command line to fire off some hold is ready for pickup SMS
# events:
#
# psql -U evergreen -h $PGHOST -d $PGDATABASE -A -t \
# -c "select id from action_trigger.event where event_def = 101 and state = 'collected'" \
# | at_fire_events.pl
#
# If you were using this for real, you'd likely also use the add_time
# or similar date field to limit the event query.
#
# It uses the same lock file as the standard action_trigger_runner.pl
# from the crontab so that this script won't interfere with its
# operation and vice versa.
